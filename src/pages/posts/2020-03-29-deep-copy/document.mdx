What is Deep Copy and what is different with shallow copy?

```js
const myObject = {
    a: "Hello",
    b: {
        c: "World"
    }
}
```

I defined the object called "myObject".
I will copy that object to another variable.

```js
const myCopiedObject = {
    ...myObject
}
```

I used spread operator to copy original object.
So "myCopiedObject" has same structure and same variables with "myObject".

Let's see next codes.

```js
myCopiedObject.a = "Bye"
myCopiedObject.b.c = "Mars"
```

---Result---

```js
console.log(myObject)
```

```json
{
    a: "Hello",
    b: {
        c: "Mars"
    }
}
```

So, we can figure out hierarchical object's elements are copied itself because "myObject"'s element "c" was changed.
